            <h1>Information</h1>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Currently working at a Longterm Care Home as a Physiotherapist 
                Assistant. When Covid became more prevalent it became more apparent to me the importance of working in a sustainable field. I then turned my head to face the world of web development.</p>
                <p>I dove right in to HTML CSS and JavaScript, and spent a few months there. After a youtube video caught my eye, I started learning the basics of C#, and I only spent a couple months 
                    here as I started feeling a little bit lost. At this point a friend of mine recommended learning Node.js, and I found it to be a fantastic addition to my growing skillset. This has 
                    led to me branching out into MongoDB, and this is where I am at currently.</p>
                <h3>Web Development Experience</h3>
                <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript (very solid understanding, and a fair bit of practice)</p>
                <p>Node.js --express, MongoDB (good grasp of main concepts, need more practice to feel comfortable)</p>
                <p>C# (pretty good understanding of the language, but felt overwhelmed with what to do with it)</p>
                <h3>Prior Work Experience</h3>
                <p>5 years as a Personal Trainer at different gyms/clinics</p>
                <p>7 years as a cook in different restaurants</p>    
                <p>2 years as a Physiotherapist Assistant at 2 Longterm Care Homes and 1 Clinic</p>    
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>Extremely motivated and independent</p>
                <p>Meticulous by nature</p>
